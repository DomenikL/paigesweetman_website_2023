              ‘Spectre Protocol’ is a Character Action game which will be
              released on the PC and PlayStation platforms. The game will follow
              the main character Vax who works as a bounty hunter in the
              cyberpunk city of ‘Cyberia’.

              As part of my school design project in which I tasked myself to
              design the world and characters for the fictional game 'Spectre
              Protocol' I also designed some game covers to go with them. These
              covers went through several iterations until I finally landed on
              my final design (voted on by my peers) which I then polished
              further and finished.

            <p>
              Hi, I’m Paige Sweetman, better known as Sappheiros online. I’ve
              been doing art for almost all of my life now and I’m currently
              working towards pursuing a career in the gaming industry possibly
              as a tech artist or a 3D modeler/texture artist. I’m in my 13th
              year at school (as of 2024) and I am hoping to study
              game development in 2025. For the majority of my artistic journey
              I have been entirely self-taught going to classes and short
              courses every few years to hone my skills further.
